Helps you make an enTrance with your music

To get it working:

- Get a [LibSpotify API key](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/)
- set environment variables SPOTIFY_KEYPATH, SPOTIFY_USERNAME, SPOTIFY_PASSWORD to the path to your Spotify API key, your spotify username, and your spotify password, respectively.
- Make sure the serial port in local_app.js is where your Arduino is connected to (we'll make this automatic later)
